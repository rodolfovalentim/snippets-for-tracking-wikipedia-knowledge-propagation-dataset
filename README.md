# Snippets for Tracking Knowledge Propagation Across Wikipedia Languages

We present a dataset of inter-language knowledge propagation in Wikipedia. The dataset includes the data from 2001 to the first trimester of 2020. Covering the entire 309 language editions and 33M articles, the dataset aims to track the full propagation history of Wikipedia concepts, and allow follow up research on building predictive models of them. For this purpose, we align all the Wikipedia articles in a language-agnostic manner according to the concept they cover, which results in 13M propagation instances. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the first to explore the full inter-language propagation at a large scale.
